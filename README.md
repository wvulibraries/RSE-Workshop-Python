# RSE-Workshop-Python

## Overview

West Virginia University (WVU) Libraries present a series of hands-on workshops aimed at helping graduate students and faculty develop programming skills using Python. These workshops cater to absolute beginners or those looking for a refresher in Python programming, data cleaning, and data visualization.

Our goal is to provide participants with a practical foundation in Python, enabling them to manage, analyze, and visualize data effectively in their academic or professional projects.
